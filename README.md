# Awesome Pizza Project

Welcome to the Awesome Pizza Project! This project is a web application for managing pizza orders, consisting of a backend built with .NET 8 and a frontend built with React.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **backend/**: Contains the .NET 8 backend code.
- **frontend/**: Contains the React frontend code.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration for running the application in containers.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata and dependencies for the frontend.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Required for running the frontend. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **.NET 8 SDK**: Required for running the backend. [Download .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **Docker Desktop**: Required for running the application using Docker. [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Running the Application

You can run the application in two ways: locally or using Docker.

### Running Locally

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Run the following command to start the backend:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```
   - Ensure you have a local instance of SQL Server running and update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file if necessary.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

### Running with Docker

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3080 for the frontend and http://localhost:3002 for the backend.       
5. Using Scripts in package.json
   The project includes several scripts in the package.json file that can be used to build and manage the application: 

   - Build Backend : Compiles the backend project. 
     ```bash
     npm run build:backend
     ```
   - Start Application : Builds the backend and starts the application using Docker.
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Restart Application : Stops and restarts the application.
     ```bash
     npm run restart
     ```
   - Stop Application : Stops the Docker containers.
     ```bash
     npm run stop
     ```
   - Run Docker Compose : Builds and runs the Docker containers.
     ```bash
     npm run docker
     ```

Testing 

Unit tests for the backend can be added using the xUnit framework. For the frontend, you can use Jest and React Testing Library.
